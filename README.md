# CSWeek6

Algo for Week 6 File IO project 
including:
fstream
iostream
string 


main ()
initialize the following
int firstInt
int secondInt 

stringstream ss 
converter ss

inputfilestream inFile

bool keepGoing = true

while keepGoing = true

open the infile 
    if getline returns false 
        then set keepGoing to false
    else
        print read successful 
        converter = the getline thing(i know we have to assign it up top)

    take the converter and assign its first token to first int, its second to secondint, and the third token to ss
    add first int and second int and assign it to firstint 
    FOR less than the int
        print the ss 

    clear the ss and the ints 
    return to the top of the while

close the file
